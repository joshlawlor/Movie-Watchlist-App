This is the movie app!

Deployed FrontEnd [here](https://runtimeterror1.herokuapp.com/)! 

This app is designed to help people find movies!

This repository contains:

1.  A [planning](https://github.com/joshlawlor/Project-3/tree/main/planning) directory for how a standard README should look.
2.  The project [BackEnd](https://github.com/joshlawlor/Project-3/tree/main/backend) Which is a server directory that uses express, mongo, and mongoose and functions mainly like an API
3.  The Project [frontEnd](https://github.com/joshlawlor/Project-3/tree/main/movie-app) using react interacts with the backend to create our webpage.
